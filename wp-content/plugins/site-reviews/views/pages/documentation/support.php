                <p>Site Reviews is updated frequently with bug patches, security updates, improvements, and new features. If you are not using the latest version and are experiencing problems, chances are good that your problem has already been addressed in the latest version.</p>

                <p class="glsr-heading">Temporarily switch to an official WordPress Theme.</p>
                <p>Try switching to an official WordPress Theme (i.e. Twenty Seventeen) and then see if you are still experiencing problems with the plugin. If this fixes the problem then there is a compatibility issue with your theme.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="glsr-heading">Temporarily deactivate all of your plugins.</p>
                <p>If switching to an official WordPress theme did not fix anything, the final thing to try is to deactivate all of your plugins except for Site Reviews. If this fixes the problem then there is a compatibility issue with one of your plugins.</p>
                <p>To find out which plugin is incompatible with Site Reviews you will need to reactivate your plugins one-by-one until you find the plugin that is causing the problem. If you think that you’ve found the culprit, deactivate it and continue to test the rest of your plugins. Hopefully you won’t find any more but it’s always better to make sure.</p>
                <p>If you find an incompatible theme or plugin, please <em>contact support</em> so we can fix it.</p>

                <p>Does your website have a SSL certificate? If it does, make sure that your website is configured to always use it by using a SSL plugin such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/">Really Simple SSL</a>. Site Reviews will use HTTPS to submit a review if possible, but if your site has a valid SSL certificate and you are viewing the website using HTTP (instead of HTTPS) then the browser will detect this as a cross-domain request and prevent the review submission from completing.</p>

                <p class="glsr-heading">I only want my reviews to show on the page they were published or assigned to but they are showing on every page.</p>
                <p>All reviews are unassigned by default. If you want to assign reviews to specific pages, you will need to use the “assign_to” and “assigned_to” shortcode options. Please see the <code><a href="<?= admin_url('edit.php?post_type=site-review&page=documentation#!shortcodes'); ?>">Shortcodes</a></code> documentation page for more information.</p>

                <p>Make sure you are not mixing up the “assign_to” and “assigned_to” shortcode options.</p>
                <p>The <code>assign_to</code> shortcode option is used in the [site_reviews_form] shortcode to <em>assign</em> submitted reviews to a page.</p>
                <p>The <code>assigned_to</code> shortcode option is used with the [site_reviews] and [site_reviews_summary] shortcodes to only show reviews that have been <em>assigned</em> to a page.</p>
