Site Reviews allows you to easily receive and display reviews for your website, business, or products.

== Description ==

> Site Reviews requires PHP v5.6 or higher!

Site Reviews allows your visitors to submit reviews with a 1-5 star rating on your website, similar to the way you would on TripAdvisor or Yelp.

The plugin provides blocks, shortcodes, and widgets, along with full documentation.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, require approval before new review submissions are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send custom notifications on a new submission, and much more.
