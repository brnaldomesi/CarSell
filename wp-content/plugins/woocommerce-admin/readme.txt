== Description ==

WooCommerce Admin is a new JavaScript-driven interface for managing your store. The plugin includes new and improved reports and a dashboard to monitor key metrics of your site.

**New Reports for WooCommerce**

WooCommerce Admin has a host of new reports that are optimized for speed and have advanced filters that allow you to dive into data about your store:

- Revenue Report
- Orders Report
- Products Report
- Categories Report
- Coupons Report
- Taxes Report
- Downloads Report
- Stock Report
- Customers Report

**Customizable Dashboard**

WooCommerce Admin also allows store owners to customize a new dashboard screen with ‚Äúperformance indicators‚Äù that correspond in importance to their store‚Äôs operation.

== Getting Started ==

Once again: This plugin is under active development and, as such, we advise you to first install WooCommerce Admin in a staging/test environment. While this code is being run in production on sites, we recommend you first verify it works for you in a test environment, the same as any plugin for WooCommerce.
